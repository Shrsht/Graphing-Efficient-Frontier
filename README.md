# Graphing-Efficient-Frontier

### (This Project is Work in Progress)


In modern portfolio theory, the efficient frontier (or portfolio frontier) is an investment portfolio which occupies the "efficient" parts of the riskâ€“return spectrum. Formally, it is the set of portfolios which satisfy the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same standard deviation of return (i.e., the risk).[1] The efficient frontier was first formulated by Harry Markowitz in 1952;[2] see Markowitz model.

In this project I use an API to obtain stock data on a give portfolio of Stocks (Tesla, Google and Apple) and use thier given closing price to calculate 2 indices: 

### Sharpe Ratio:
The Sharpe ratio compares the return of an investment with its risk. It's a mathematical expression of the insight that excess returns over a period of time may signify more volatility and risk, rather than investing skill.

### Portfolio Variance:
This is  statistical value that assesses the degree of dispersion of the returns of a portfolio.
